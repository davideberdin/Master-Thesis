\begin{abstract}
Learning and improving a second language is fundamental in the globalised world we live in. In particular, English is the common tongue used everyday by billions of people and the necessity of having good pronunciation in order to avoid misunderstanding is higher then ever. Smartphones and other mobile devices have rapidly become an every-day technology with endless potential given the large size of screens as well as the high portability. Old-fashioned language courses are very useful and important, however using the technology for picking up a new language in an automatic way with less time to dedicated to this process is still a challenge and an open research field. In this thesis, we describe a new method to improve the English language pronunciation of non-native speakers through the usage of a smartphone, using a machine learning approach. The aim is to provide the right tools for those users that want to quickly improve their English pronunciation without attending an actual course.
The test has been conducted on users using the application for two weeks. The results show that the proposed approach is not particularly effective on people due the difficulty in understanding the feedback we delivered. \vspace{5in}

\renewcommand{\abstractname}{Acknowledgements}
\begin{abstract}
Foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Prof. Philip J. Guo for the continuous support during my time doing research, for his motivation and enthusiasm. He gave me the opportunity to experience research almost at Ph.D level as well as the opportunity to study in the U.S. I cannot thank enough for that.

Besides my supervisor, I would like to thank my reviewer, Olle G{\"a}llmo for his insightful comments and suggestions when writing this thesis.

My sincere thanks also go to the Department of Computer Science at University of Rochester for guesting me during my research time there. I had the opportunity to study in one of the top notch university in the world and to experience the American life-style in all its essence.

I want to thank two incredible students I had the opportunity to work with at U of R: Jeremy Warner and Leonard Brown. Their infinite patience in listening to all the issues I had during the development and their great support in providing suggestions and workarounds helped me to finish the project (not to mention all the stimulating discussions about the world!).

Also I thank my friends at Uppsala University: Francesca Martin, John Paton, Laurence Wainwright and all the people from the Computer Science department - I would like to list all of you guys but you are so many!

Last but not the least, I would like to thank my family: my parents Lorella and Dino and my brother Elia, for helping me to realize my dream of studying in America, encouraging me through all the hard times and their unwavering faith in my capabilities. I could never imagine to achieve what I did without knowing that their were always there for me. I will never forget it!
