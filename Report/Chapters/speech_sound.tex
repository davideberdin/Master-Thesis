\chapter{Sounds of General American English}
\label{ch:english_language}
In \textit{General American English} there are 41 different sounds that can be structured by the way they are produced. In Table~\ref{table:english_sounds} the kind of sounds with the respective number of possible productions is shown. Each type will be described in a dedicated section of this thesis. An important factor is the way \textit{constriction} of the flow of air is made. In fact, to distinguish between \textit{consonants}, \textit{semivowels} and \textit{vowels}, the \textit{degree} of constriction is checked. Instead, for \textit{sonorant} consonants the air flow is continuous with no pressure. \textit{Nasal} consonants have an occlusive consonant made with a lowered velum, thus allowing the airflow in the nasal cavity. The \textit{continuant} consonants are produced without blocking the airflow in the oral cavity.

\section{Vowel production}
\label{sec:vowel_production}
Generally speaking, when a vowel is pronounced, there is no air-constriction in the flow. This means that the articulators, like the tongue, lips and uvula do not touch, allowing the flow of air from the lungs. The consonants instead have another pattern when producing them. Moreover, to produce each vowel, the mouth has to make a different shape in such a way that the resonance is different. Figure~\ref{fig:vowels_prod} shows the way the mouth, the jaw and the lips are combined in a such a way to produce the acoustic sound of a vowel.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/vowels_prod.png}
    \caption{Vowels production \cite{mit_phonetics}}
    \label{fig:vowels_prod}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Vowel of American English}
\label{sub:vowel_of_american_english}
There are 18 different vowels in American English that can be grouped by three different sets: the \textbf{monopthongs}, the \textbf{diphthongs}, and the \textbf{schwa's}, or reduced vowels.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/vowels_sets.png}
    \caption{Example of words depending on the group \cite{mit_phonetics}}
    \label{fig:vowels_sets}
\end{figure}

\noindent The first column shows some examples of monopthongs. A \textit{monopthong} is a clear vowel sound in which the utterance is fixed at both the beginning and at the end. The central part of the picture represents the diphthongs. A \textit{diphthong} is the sound produced by two vowels when they occur within the same syllable. In the last column are depicted some examples of reduced vowels. \textit{Schwa's} refers to the vowel sound that stays in the mid-central of the word. In general, in English, the schwa is found in an unstressed position.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Formants}
\label{sub:formants}
A \textit{formant} is the resonant frequency of a vocal track that resonate the loudest. In a spectrum graph, formants are represented by the peaks. In Figure~\ref{fig:peaks_formants} it is possible to see how the three first formants are defined by the peaks. The picture is of the \textit{envelope}, a spectrogram of the vowel \textbf{[i]}. Frequencies are the most relevant information to determine which vowel has been pronounced. In general, within a spectrum graph there may be a different number of formants, although the most relevant are the first three and they are named \textbf{F1}, \textbf{F2} and \textbf{F3}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Figures/peaks_formants.png}
    \caption{Spectral envelope of the [i] vowel pronunciation. F1, F2 and F3 are the first 3 formants \cite{formants_peaks}}
    \label{fig:peaks_formants}
\end{figure}

\noindent The frequencies produced by the formants are highly dependent on the tongue position. In fact, formant \textit{F1}'s frequencies are produced when the tongue is either in a \textit{high} or \textit{low} position, whereas formant \textit{F2} when the tongue is in either \textit{front} or \textit{back} position and formant \textit{F3} when the tongue is doing \textit{Retroflexion}. \textbf{Retroflection} is more present when pronouncing the consonant \textit{R}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Vowel duration}
\label{sub:vowel_duration}
The duration of a vowel is the time that is taken when pronouncing it. Duration is measured in \textit{centiseconds} and in English\footnote{In Icelandic as well} the different lengths are defined by certain rules. In general, the length of \textit{lax vowels} such as /\textipa{I e \ae 2 6 u 9}/ are short whereas \textit{tense vowels} like /\textipa{i: A: O: u: 3:}/ including diphthongs /\textipa{eI aI OI 9U aU I9 ea U9}/ have a variable length but longer than lax vowels \cite{vowel_length}. Figure~\ref{fig:vowel_length} is an example of time-length of some vowels.
\noindent In General American English, the length of vowels are not as distinctive as in the \textit{RP}\footnote{More commonly referred as the Standard English in the UK} pronunciation. In some American accents, to express an emphasis the length of vowels can be extended.

    \label{fig:vowel_length}
\end{figure}

\section{Fricative Production}
\label{sec:fricative_production}
A \textbf{fricative} is a consonant sound that is produced by narrowing the cavity causing a friction as the air goes through it \cite{fricatives}. There are eight fricatives in American English divided into two categories: \textit{Unvoiced} and \textit{Voiced}. These two categories are often called \textit{Non-Strident} and \textit{Strident} which means that there is a constriction behind the alveolar ridge.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/fricative_production.png}
    \caption{Fricative production \cite{mit_phonetics}}
    \label{fig:fricative_prod}
\end{figure}

\noindent In Figure~\ref{fig:fricative_ex} it is possible to see some examples of these two categories. Each consonant also belongs to a specific articulation position. In fact, each figure in \ref{fig:fricative_prod} represents a specific articulation position. From left to right there is: \textit{Labio-Dental} (Labial), \textit{Interdental} (Dental), \textit{Alveolar} and \textit{Palato-Alveolar} (Palatal).

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/fricative_examples.png}
    \caption{Fricative examples of productions \cite{mit_phonetics}}
    \label{fig:fricative_ex}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Affricate Production}
\label{sec:Affricate Production}
An \textbf{affricate} consonant is produced by stopping the airflow first and then release it similarly to a fricative. The result is also considered a \textit{turbulence noise} since the produced sound has a sudden release of the constriction. In English there only two affricate phonemes, as depicted in \ref{fig:affricate_prod}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/affricative_production.png}
    \caption{Affricative production \cite{mit_phonetics}}
    \label{fig:affricate_prod}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Aspirant Production}
\label{sec:Aspirant Production}
An \textbf{aspirant} consonant is a strong outbreak of breath produced by generating a turbulent airflow at glottis level. In American English there exists only one aspirant consonant and it is the /\textipa{h}/, for instance in the word \textit{hat}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Stop Production}
\label{sec:Stop Producton}
A \textbf{stop} is a consonant sound formed by stopping the airflow in the oral cavity. The stop consonant is also known as \textit{plosive}, which means that when the air is released it creates a small \textit{explosive} sound \cite{stop_consonants}. The occlusion can come up in three different variance as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:stop_prod}: from left to right there is a \textit{Labial} occlusion, the \textit{Alveolar} occlusion and the \textit{Velar} occlusion. The pressure built up in the vocal tract, determine the produced sound depending on which occlusion is performed.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/stop_production.png}
    \caption{Stop production \cite{mit_phonetics}}
    \label{fig:stop_prod}
\end{figure}

\noindent In American English there are six stop consonants, as represented in \ref{fig:stop_ex}. As for the fricative consonants, the two main categories are the \textit{Voiced} and \textit{Unvoiced} sounds. Although, a particularity of the Unvoiced stops is that they are typically \textit{aspirated} whereas in the Voiced ones there is a \textit{voice-bar} during the closure movement. These two particularities are very useful where analyzing the formants because the frequencies are very well distinguished allowing a classification system to better understand the difference between stop phonemes.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/stop_examples.png}
    \caption{Stop examples of production \cite{mit_phonetics}}
    \label{fig:stop_ex}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Nasal Production}
\label{sec:Nasal Production}
A \textbf{nasal} is an occlusive consonant sound that is produced by the lowering of the soft palate \textit{(lowered velum)} at the back of the mouth, allowing the airflow to go out through the nostrils \cite{nasal_speech_sound}. Because the airflow escapes through the nose, the consonants are produced with a closure in the vocal tract. Figure~\ref{fig:nasal_prod} shows the three different positions to produce a nasal consonant. From left to right the positions are \textit{Labial}, \textit{Alveolar} and \textit{Velar}. \\
\noindent Due to this particularity, the frequencies of nasal \textit{murmurs} are quite similar. Examining the spectrogram in Figure~\ref{fig:nasal_spectrogram}, it is possible to notice that nasal consonants have a high similarity. In a classification system, this can be a problem.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Figures/nasal_spectrogram.png}
    \caption{Nasal Spectrograms of \textbf{dinner}, \textbf{dimmer}, \textbf{dinger} \cite{nasal_spectrogram}}
    \label{fig:nasal_spectrogram}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/nasal_production.png}
    \caption{Nasal production \cite{mit_phonetics}}
    \label{fig:nasal_prod}
\end{figure}

\noindent Since the sound produced by a nasal is produced with an occlusive vocal tract, each consonant is \textbf{always attached} to a vowel and it can form an entire syllable. Although, in English, the consonant /\textbf{\textipa{N}}/ always occur immediately after a vowel. In Figure~\ref{fig:nsal_ex} are shown some examples of nasal consonants divided by articulation position.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/nasal_examples.png}
    \caption{Nasal examples of production \cite{mit_phonetics}}
    \label{fig:nsal_ex}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Semivowel Production}
\label{sec:Semivowels Production}
A \textbf{semivowel} is a sound that is very close to a vowel sound but it works more likely as a syllable boundary rather than a core of a syllable \cite{ladefoged1998sounds}. A typical example of semivowels in English are the \textbf{y} and \textbf{w} in words \textit{yes} and \textit{west}. In the \textit{IPA} alphabet they are written /\textipa{j}/ and /\textipa{w}/ and they correspond to the vowels /\textipa{i:}/ and /\textipa{u:}/ in the words \textit{seen} and \textit{moon}. In Figure~\ref{fig:semivowel_ex} there are some examples of semivowels production. \\
\noindent The sound is produced by making a constriction in the oral cavity without having any sort of air turbulence. To achieve that, the articulation motion is slower than other consonants because the laterals\footnote{They are a pair of upper teeth that are located laterally from the central incisors \cite{laterals_wiki}} form a complete closer combined with a tongue tip. In this way the airflow has to pour out using the sides of the constriction.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/semivowel_production.png}
    \caption{Semivowel production \cite{mit_phonetics}}
    \label{fig:semivowel_prod}
\end{figure}

\noindent In American English there are four semivowels and they are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:semivowel_prod}. An important fact about semivowels is that they are always close to a vowel. Although, the /\textipa{l}/ can form an entire syllable by itself when there is no stress in a word.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/semivowel_examples.png}
    \caption{Semivowel examples of production \cite{mit_phonetics}}
    \label{fig:semivowel_ex}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Acoustic Properties of Semivowels}
\label{ssub:Acousitc Properties of Semivowels}
Semivowels have some properties that are taken into account when doing any sort of analysis. In fact, /\textipa{w}/ and /\textipa{l}/ are the semivowels that are more confusable because both are characterized by a \textit{low} range of frequencies for both formants \textit{F1} and \textit{F2}. Although, the /\textipa{w}/ can be distinguished by the \textit{rapid falloff} in the F2 spectrogram whereas /\textipa{l}/ has more often a \textit{high frequency energy} compared to /\textipa{w}/. The \textbf{energy} is the relationship between the \textit{wavelength} and the \textit{frequency}. So, having a high energy means that there is a high frequency value and a small wavelength \cite{energy_relationship}. \\
\noindent The semivowel /\textipa{y}/ is characterized by having a very low frequency value in formant F1 and a very high in formant F2. The /\textipa{r}/ instead is presented with a very low frequency value of formant F3.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{The Syllable}
\label{sec:The syllable}
The definition of the \textbf{syllable} can be divided in two sub-definitions: one from the phonetic point of view and one from the phonological point of view. \\
\noindent In phonetic analysis, syllables are basic units of speech  which \textit{"are usually described as consisting of a centre which has little or no obstruction to airflow and which sounds comparatively loud; before and after that centre (...) there will be greater obstruction to airflow and/or less loud sound"} \cite{roach2000phonology}. Taking the word \textit{cat} (/\textipa{k\ae t}/) as example, the \textbf{centre} is defined by the vowel /\textipa{\ae}/ in which takes place only a little obstruction. The surrounding \textit{plosive} consonants (/\textipa{k}/ and /\textipa{t}/) the airflow is completely blocked \cite{syllable_site}. \\
\noindent A phonological definition of the syllable establishes that it is \textit{"a complex unit made up of nuclear and marginal elements"}\cite{laver1994principles}. In this context, the vowels are considered the \textbf{Nuclear} elements, or syllabic segments, whereas the \textbf{Marginal} ones are the consonants, or non-syllabic segments \cite{syllable_site}. Considering the word \textit{paint} (/\textipa{peInt}/) for example, the nuclear element is defined by the diphthong /\textipa{eI}/ whereas /\textipa{p}/ and /\textipa{nt}/ are the marginal elements.

\subsection{Syllable Structure}
In the phonological theory, the syllable can be decomposed in a hierarchical structure instead of a linear one. The structure starts with the $\sigma$ letter which represents not only the root, but the syllable itself. Immediately after, there are two \textit{branches} called \textbf{constituents} that represent the \textit{Onset} and the \textit{Rhyme}. The left branch includes any consonants that precede the vowel (or Nuclear element), whereas the right branch includes both the nuclear element and any consonants (or Marginal elements) that potentially could follow it. \\
\noindent Usually, the rhyme branch is further split into two other branches represented by the \textbf{Nucleus} and the \textbf{Coda}. The first one represents the nuclear element in the syllable. The second one instead, subsumes all the consonants that follow the Nucleus in the syllable \cite{syllable_site}. In Figure~\ref{fig:syllable_structure} there is a representation of the syllable structure based on the word \textit{plant}.

\subsection{Stress}
\label{sec:stress}

In the areas of linguistic studies and speech recognition, the stress is the emphasis that a person puts in a specific part of a word or sentence. Typically, the stress part of a word/sentence is detected by paying attention to the sudden change of pitch or increased loudness. \\
\noindent Figure~\ref{fig:stress_ex} is an example in which more emphases is given when pronouncing that particular sentence. The big black dots represent such emphasis.
